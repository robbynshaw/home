      <description>Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life. Proverbs 13:12 ESV
 To love is to open the heart, to stretch out with trust and reach across the abyss of the unknown to another. When that love is not returned, the heart is overwhelmed with sickness. Thus it is that we turn to various remedies. We lower our expectations; we build up our resolve; we numb our pain.</description>
