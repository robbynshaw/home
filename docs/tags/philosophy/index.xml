      <description>These days, these precious days which I can hardly touch, my tears are always only ever a loosened breath away. I hate them, I miss them, I beckon them, and I retreat.
The days before I drove to the hospital, my mind was on the character of greatness. Across the hospital bed in the PICU, I watched my mother and her sad eyes reassure, caress, hold steady. Greatness is a calm and swelling ocean in a tender shell.</description>
