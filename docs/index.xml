      <description>I am incapable of returning items to a store. This problem is not entirely based on forgetfulness, though that does play a part, but is due to a phobia that I developed somewhere along the way. The idea of walking up to a counter and stating that I would like to return something sends shivers up my spine. If I attempt said act, I will surely be paralyzed by utter panic before I make it to the counter.</description>

      <description>How To Hunt Transcendence R.N. Shaw 2014-03-01 Identifying root emotions is tricky business. The quiet ones often do it well&amp;ndash;us watchers. We sit in caf√© corners and look at the eyes floating about, disjointed from their bodies&amp;ndash;out of sync. The cues are subtle at first, but soon the art is mastered. We capture souls as they walk past.
I am a connoisseur of beautiful souls, and a surgeon. I snatch up the rare specimens and breathe them deep inside, pulling the layers off piece by piece.</description>

      <description>These days, these precious days which I can hardly touch, my tears are always only ever a loosened breath away. I hate them, I miss them, I beckon them, and I retreat.
The days before I drove to the hospital, my mind was on the character of greatness. Across the hospital bed in the PICU, I watched my mother and her sad eyes reassure, caress, hold steady. Greatness is a calm and swelling ocean in a tender shell.</description>

      <title>The Coroner I Met at the Bar</title>

      <description>When they banned smoking from bars here in . . . well, everywhere, the coroner marked the time and date for the spiritual meaning of the beloved saloon. The bar no longer makes sense, and I sit here and fondle the thought that this simple, pointed break is crackling now through the structure, the soft release of a delicate tension, and this thread skeleton sags under the breath of the still air, that artful balance of human nature which is the bar is now crumbling into a dull, dried splatter of blood.</description>
