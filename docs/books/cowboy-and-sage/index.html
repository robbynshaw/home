  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://rnshaw.com/cowboy-and-sage"><strong>&ldquo;Cowboy &amp; Sage&rdquo;</strong></a> is a narrative, a guide, a
dialogue, and the history of an echo&ndash;the sound of the Comforter
roaming the earth, crackling through the dusty alleyways, winnowing
the wheat, testing for fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cowboy &amp; Sage&rdquo; is the history of a movement of which you may
only have heard faint whispers in dark corners&ndash;<strong>The Echo of
Christ</strong>. And you will not find the voices speaking
louder. The Echo moves where you will her.</p>
<p>You may find a piece of the history within yourself, as I have, or
you may wonder where the boundaries of fiction and reality lie, as I
have as well. But nonetheless, I will present to you what I have
found.</p>
<p>I am currently transcribing a narrative that has been passed on to
me from a very trusted colleague. The book is simply called &ldquo;Cowboy
&amp; Sage,&rdquo; and being the primary source for this clandestine
movement, I have named the website appropriately.</p>
<p>However, the book is rather large, with portions missing and
incomplete, so I have divided up the task of transcription into more
attainable and digestible bits, being for now the
<a href="https://rnshaw.com/cowboy-and-sage-prelude"><strong>&ldquo;Prelude&rdquo;</strong></a> and <strong>&ldquo;The Echo of
Christ,&quot;</strong> with more to come as I am able.</p>
<p>I hope you find that I do justice to the task at hand, and of the
material presented, you may be the judge.</p>
<p>But take heed, it is not a book you judge, but a spirit.</p>
<p>And a spirit must be worn.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
