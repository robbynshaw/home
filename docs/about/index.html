</code></pre></div><p>Identifying root emotions is tricky business. The quiet ones often
do it well&ndash;us <em>watchers</em>. We sit in café corners and look at
the eyes floating about, disjointed from their bodies&ndash;out of sync.
The cues are subtle at first, but soon the art is mastered. We
capture souls as they walk past.</p>
<p>I am a connoisseur of beautiful souls, and a surgeon. I snatch up
the rare specimens and breathe them deep inside, pulling the layers
off piece by piece. I make the beauty <em>speak</em>.</p>
<p>(For the victim, the process is painless. Only the eyes will know,
if they can catch a glimpse of the kidnapping. The real pain is for
the watcher; objectification&ndash;dissection of
the new-found prize&ndash;a weighty addiction.)</p>
<p>When the <em>watcher</em> is young, she discovers that watching is a
powerful self-analysis. She uncovers her own dark corners as she
learns the delicate scalpel. She begins to fear the secrets within.
A remedy? Exhibitionism. Martyrdom. Shed light on the dark corners.</p>
<p>Most of us believe that a person has a center&ndash;some secret hidden in
the core which, if uncovered, would give them away. If we knew their
innermost dwelling, we would know them completely&ndash;we would
<em>understand</em> them. But the watchers know better.</p>
<p>After she exhibits her naked secrets to the crowd, the watcher only
becomes more <em>unknown</em>, more distant from kidnapping eyes.
Her soul frees itself to roam upon the strange places of the land
and sky, in a course dictated only by the wind. Her soul will never
now be understood. She has become wild, dangerous&ndash;<em>feral.</em></p>
<p>Now, at last, her wild eyes lay disguised in the corner of
the café. She prowls the civilized savanna, searching for a hint of
Truth, for the prize above all prizes, for the <em>most beautiful
soul</em>.</p>
<p>Its disguise will be perfected. The only hints will be buried
beneath the eyes&ndash;a soft glow and dark shadows, tell-tale signs of
the watcher above all watchers&ndash;iridescent joy and melancholy roots.</p>
<p>She fingers her scalpel.</p>
