<p>Hope deferred makes the heart sick,

<p>To love is to open the heart, to stretch out with trust and reach across
the abyss of the unknown to another. When that love is not returned, the
heart is overwhelmed with sickness. Thus it is that we turn to various
remedies. We lower our expectations; we build up our resolve; we numb our pain.</p>
<p>In these moments, it appears to me that our response is left without counsel.
How we respond to <em>hope deferred</em> is a critical arena in which we are largely
unskilled and untaught. Furthermore, from my observations over the years, it
is in this arena that some of our most basic presumptions about love find their
testing ground and often come up short. It is my hope, therefore, that the
following essay will shine some much needed light upon the subject, both for
myself and anyone else who often finds sickness welling up in their heart.</p>
<p><strong>Due warning:</strong> The context for this essay is Christianity, for that is
where my most crucial ideas of love have been informed and also where my
questions concerning this matter have far too often come up short.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the Christian paradigm, love is transformative. At the root of the Christian
hope is the idea that the love of Christ broke into the world and restored a
people to God. That love then is borne into the Christian people through which
they are to restore the rest of the world&rsquo;s people to God. They are to be the
vessel of change to the world through this powerful, given love.</p>
<p>In practice, this transformative love does not often find its way into our
beliefs about love returned. <em>Love returned</em> is, I presume, one of our greatest
sources of hope, and therefore of <em>hope deferred</em>. We put love into the world,
into those we care about, and we do not see it returned&ndash;sometimes not at all,
sometimes not for a great amount of time, and often times not in the way that
we need or desire. One would assume that this is the arena in which
Christianity could and should shine the most&ndash;that Christians, believing thusly
in the transformative power of love, would have a near everlasting patience
and hope for seeing the results of that power&ndash;for seeing their love returned.
In general, I do not see that to be the case&ndash;not in my own life and often
not in the lives of other Christians that I know.</p>
<p>I do not believe that the fault is entirely our own lack of trying. Rather,
it appears to me that a number of conflicting ideas and a lack of practical
wisdom exist in the Christian paradigm which make believing in the
transformative power of love in such a way exceedingly difficult. These
thoughts are summarized as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sacrifice as a model of love.</li>
<li>The non-linear economy of the Kingdom of God.</li>
<li>A lack of practical wisdom in regards to the negative energy necessarily
associated with hope deferred.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sacrifice-as-a-model-of-love">Sacrifice as a Model of Love</h2>
<p>The model of love which Christianity purports is often somewhat vague
and confusing, and on the whole, appears to be without general consensus.</p>
<p>Modern secular notions of love generally adhere to the idea of love as
an act which flows out of an abundance of positive energy towards another
entity. In the secular idea, love from a sacrificial outlook is generally
regarded as unhealthy, especially in the long term. The modern secular
paradigm does allow for sacrificial acts as a healthy behavior, but
generally in small doses and in the context of duty or for the success
of long-term goals. For example, one should go to work even if one does
not have good feelings about going to work, but at some point if those
feelings continue, one should get a new job. Marriage is generally viewed
in a like manner. One should do their best to show love to their spouse,
even when they do not feel loving, but if that feeling of unloving
continues for a long period of time and recourses to fix those feelings
do not succeed, the marriage may be reasonably ended in the minds of the
secular majority.</p>
<p>In modern Christian notions of love, <em>love itself is regarded as a duty</em>,
and sacrifice towards that duty is regarded as generally healthy
and often praiseworthy. Even if the Christian doesn&rsquo;t have good feelings
toward someone, they are to produce acts of love toward that person.
Thus it becomes possible, given this idea, that a person may be a <em>good
Christian</em> without having feelings of love towards others in general.</p>
<p>I suspect that many people will have resistance to what I just stated,
but I propose that such resistance largely supports my statement above
that the Christian paradigm is quite confused about what practical love
means. In defense of this idea, let us look at why
loving in such a way, that is without positive feelings, is often deemed
acceptable in Christianity.</p>
<p>To begin, the doctrine of <em>Original Sin</em> is generally accepted among
most Christians. This doctrine in essence describes humanity as corrupt
at the root. Thus, the Christian is instructed to act against this evil
nature and turn towards the Holy Spirit&ndash;the corrective nature which must
overcome and replace our original, sinful nature. Believing this doctrine
enables one to easily justify any negative thoughts or feelings about
other people or entities as emerging from that sinful nature. The crucial
part for the Christian is that they do not accept that nature, but act
in accordance with the Spirit, that is, act with love towards others.
One can easily see then how something of a split self can emerge and be
seen as reasonable or even necessary. The same person can reasonably do
loving things towards others without a loving heart.</p>
<p>I would propose that this idea of practical love without positive
feelings reveals an incomplete belief in the transformative power of
love, particularly in regard to the transformation of the self in response
to that love. However, the matter is not quite that easily resolved.</p>
<p>In Christianity, we are also given a vision of the Christian, that is, the person
<em>saved by the work of Christ</em> as transformed <em>and</em> transforming. This
duality is true for both the Christian and the community of Christians at
large, i.e. the Church. Christianity carries the weight of incompletion at
its very core. The Christian receives Christ as the Holy Spirit when the
initial transformation in their life takes place, but they are also to wait
with a longing heart for the completion of that work when Christ comes
back to earth. We see in the letters of the New Testament, especially the
Pauline letters, that the Christian is thus to continually strive to live
in that new transformation while fighting the temptation to fall back into
the old, corrupted self. Thus, any work that the Christian does is work
in an imperfect environment, some of which is destined to fail due to
the <em>soil</em> upon which it falls.</p>
<p>Given this hope of a distant completion, then, it becomes difficult to tell
what expectations are reasonable or unreasonable for the Christian. Which
part of the self is transformed by Christ, and which part will be left
incomplete until Christ returns? What exactly is the work which the Holy
Spirit performed in our life, and what is the work which He is now
performing?</p>
<p>Though I do not presume to understand the answers to these questions, I
do believe that we would be amiss not to adjust our understanding of
the Christian practice of love regarding these ideas. As I said above,
it seems that if we do not believe that the love which Christ bestowed
upon us has the power to transform our feelings towards others here and
now, we do not wholly believe in the message of Christ. If we, as
Christians, are to be the vessel of God&rsquo;s love on earth, it would seem
strange that the heart of God towards others is not also given to us.
This would include the love of our enemies which Jesus purports. When we
are instructed to pray for our enemies, for those who do us wrong,
is not that prayer for us as well? If we merely ask God to &lsquo;take care
of them&rsquo; and to &lsquo;heal them&rsquo; from their wicked ways, are we not merely
asking God to help us? Rather we should seek their good&ndash;we should
seek to press the love of God into them through our prayers. The very
Christ who instructed us to &lsquo;love our enemies&rsquo; also instructed us not
to judge, and if by our prayer we judge, or even presume to know what
sin our enemy has or has not committed, what spiritual confusion we
must reside within!</p>
<p>Let us instead seek the heart of God, and believe that such a gracious
and warm heart is available for us today. And if we do not find that
heart, let us ask that we may receive, and press into faith in the
transformative love of Christ.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned,
but have not love, I gain nothing.
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13&amp;version=ESV">1 Corinthians 13:3 ESV</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-non-linear-economy-of-the-kingdom-of-god">The Non-Linear Economy of the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>We have now covered, at least in part, some of the confusion that
resides within Christianity in regards to love as it emerges from us
towards others. However, to fully understand the practice of that
love, we must also understand what happens to that love after it is
given away to others, and this is also an area of confusion in
Christianity.</p>
<p>Just as the Christian believes that he is a work both transformed
and being transformed, burdened with an original, sinful nature,
so also is the world in which the Christian works incomplete and
burdened with sin. This is further confounded by the idea of free
will in Christianity.</p>
<p>All debates about predestination aside, most Christians believe
in some respect that God gives humans free will. This idea
is critical to the Christian framework, as it is, in the end, our
choice to be restored or not to be restored by the work of Christ.</p>
<p>In this context, then, when the Christian prays for her enemy or
acts with transformative love toward that enemy, the power of God
appears to be at an impasse. Regardless of how we or the Holy Spirit
act in that person&rsquo;s life, it is up to the person to respond
favorably and be transformed by that love. That is, if the love is
not accepted, its transformative nature appears to be nullified.</p>
<p>If this is the context in which the Christian works, it would seem
to follow that the Christian is doomed to perform her work of love
sacrificially&ndash;continually offering that love with only a vague
hope of an occasional return.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the idea of loving <em>for the sake of a return</em> in
Christianity is generally denounced as unhealthy. Where this idea
descends from I am not wholly sure, as no particular Biblical
evidence comes to mind. This denunciation does make a good deal of
sense, though, given this context of free will. We simply cannot
expect our love of others to find suitable soil in all or even in
most cases.</p>
<p>Regardless, I am not convinced that it is unhealthy to hope for a
return on our investment, nor for that hoped-for-return to be love.
That we see this type of love as unhealthy seems to belay an
underlying belief that love and duty are one and the same in
Christianity. While it is certainly true that <em>to love</em> is a, if
not <em>the</em>, Christian duty, it does not follow that love <em>is</em> duty.
And while I don&rsquo;t think that most Christians would agree with the
statement that &lsquo;love equals duty&rsquo; when written down, it does appear
that most of us operate out of something like that understanding.</p>
<p>In the Christian story, God clearly loves us in the hope that such
a love will be returned in kind. If that were not the case, sending
Jesus would not make much sense. Certainly He could wish us to simply
have a better life, and restoring wholeness to our spiritual selves
would be a good step towards that end. Nevertheless, if that were God&rsquo;s only
goal, He could have simply not given us free will to begin with and
instead made us drugged up automata. We would certainly be much happier
then, even if we never knew it.</p>
<p>The truth is that God gave us love so that we could love Him back. And
I believe that we would be much better off if we loved for the same
reason.</p>
<p>Even with all of that being said, though, there is some reasonable
resistance to that idea. Is it not the case that the Christian loves
a person so that said person will come to love Christ? And if that is
the end goal, then we should not expect love returned to us, but rather
love returned to its origin&ndash;to God Himself. There is a good deal of
evidence to support this idea. Jesus seems to point to this idea often
when He speaks about the economy of the Kingdom of God in general. One
plants a seed, he says, and then it grows up somewhere unexpected and
in an unexpected manner. At another time, one puts in the work, and
someone else later receives the harvest. Add to these thoughts the
principal of free will, and the theory seems pretty well complete.</p>
<p>I believe that here, as before, we are also conflating ideas which do
not need to be joined. Hope in an imperfect world must, of course,
remain hope. And hope requires both faith and patience: faith that God
will finish the work and patience in His timing and the timing of
those for which we work. However, we pass on the love given us by
Christ not as an object which we have received but as a way of being
in which we now partake. To partake in that love is to love others as
God loves others, and God loves others that He may be loved back. The
Kingdom of God is based on that reciprocation of love, not only back
towards God but also back towards each other. The non-linear economy
of the Kingdom, i.e. the fact that reciprocated love often returns
in unexpected places and in unexpected ways, does not negate this fact
but rather appends it with a beautiful, ground-breaking idea of
community in which love for others always finds its return in the
community of Christians at large. As I see it, Jesus seemed to be
saying that due to the nature of this world, we may put a little
seed of love into someone else, and we may never see that love
returned to us directly. Nevertheless, if the seed finds good soil,
that love will come back into the community of Christians, that is,
the Kingdom of God, and grow into something unimaginably brilliant
and powerful. In that reciprocation of love we may justly put our
hope.</p>
<p>If my estimations are correct, then, <em>we must love in the hope of
love returned.</em> Love is not equivalent to duty. Yet we must also
have faith and patience in the manner of that return. <em>We must
believe in the hand of the greatest Gardener of all.</em> The bride
of Christ is the Church&ndash;not you or I individually, but all of us
together, and <em>through each other that love returns to Christ.</em></p>
<p>We set out at the beginning of this venture to understand what
often prevents the Christian from acting out of a place of
transformative love in his daily life. I hope that we have now
cleared away some of the confusion that may be blocking us
from this goal. What remains now is to get at least some idea of
how these ideas could come into practice, for in my own life at
least, practical wisdom in this arena has always been lacking.</p>
<h2 id="practical-wisdom-regarding-hope-deferred">Practical Wisdom Regarding Hope Deferred</h2>
<p>I would like to precede with a thought experiment surrounding an act of
love. It is commonplace in thought experiments to use a very pure
example of the phenomenon in question. In the case of love, however,
I feel that such an attempt might lead us down the wrong path, so I
feel obliged to begin with a bit of a preface.</p>
<h3 id="pure-love">Pure Love</h3>
<p>In our culture, we commonly say something like &ldquo;it was an act or pure love,&rdquo;
or make reference to an act of love which was impure. This, of course, implies
that there is such a thing as <em>impure love</em>. Is that true?</p>
<p>What we often mean by &lsquo;pure love&rsquo; is something like an act of love which
has one or both of the following characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>The source of the act is purely positive energy towards the beloved.</li>
<li>The actor is acting without regard to herself (i.e. it is self-
sacrificial)</li>
</ol>
<p>In truth, we generally have only vague connotations of what something like
<em>pure</em> or <em>impure</em> love would be. Generally we just believe that we know
what it looks or feels like. I propose, however, that much of this is
at least partly non-sense.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the first one. We all know that none of us have the benefit
of always having one emotion or intention at a time. In fact, as intentions
go, we generally are never quite certain what our intentions actually are.
Often we find after many years that devious intentions lurked underneath
some of what we thought were <em>pure</em> intentions. We all know this to be
a normal part of life. It&rsquo;s why people go to therapy. It&rsquo;s why we should pray.
Only God knows why we do what we do.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in most complex relationships, (that is, those lasting more than
a few seconds), we carry a host of thoughts and emotions about the other
person in our psyche. Often many of these emotions and thoughts conflict
with one another. Some of them we repress, some of them we dismiss, and many
of them we ignore. To think that we ever act out of <em>pure positive energy</em>
towards another person is nonsensical. We act out of what we have been
given and what we have molded or been transformed into. Thus, to love
is always to reveal a snapshot of our (impure) selves.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we can often feel the balance of positive vs. negative
energy from a person towards us, and it is this balance which we seem
to refer to when we talk about pure love. Yet we must also be aware that
our vantage point is always skewed. We so often project our own energies
and insecurities onto others that we can never truly be certain of the
<em>state</em> of that persons actions. In truth, <em>if there ever were such an
act of pure love, we could never recognize it.</em></p>
<p>In regards to the second one, whether the lover acted with regards to
himself, we have already remarked on its folly. Healthy love is
not self-sacrificial. It certainly should be patient and gracious, but
love does expect a return. If it does not, it is simply duty.</p>
<p>It seems then that <em>impure</em> love is either just love that could be
better or something which is altogether not actually love. In our
attempt to gain a practical understanding of transformative love, then,
let us not attempt to use an example of <em>pure</em> love.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we still must come to at least a basic understanding of
what an act of love would look like.</p>
<h3 id="a-simple-act-of-love">A Simple Act of Love</h3>
<p>All of us have experienced, hopefully on a regular basis, performing
what we deem to be a simple act of love. Let us try to define some
characteristics of such an act.</p>
<ol>
<li>The act is kind. That is, we believe the action to benefit the
person acted upon.</li>
<li>The act is an expression of our feelings towards that person.
That is, we believe the action to be a representation of our
positive feelings towards the person acted upon.</li>
<li>The act is not necessary. That is, we are not required by law
or duty to perform the action.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two of these characteristics I believe are fairly simple
and reasonable. The third characteristic requires a bit more explanation.</p>
<p>I should hope that it is possible to perform an action which is
required by law or duty in a loving manner, and we often speak about
activities in such a way. For instance, if I feed my kids dinner, I
am loving them, yet I also am required by law and general family duty
to do so. For the purposes of our conversation, though, this quite
confuses the matter, particularly because we often do not expect
reciprocation in these matters in a straightforward way. For instance,
I do not expect my children to give me a hug because I fed them, though
I may expect some general form of respect. For the sake of this thought
experiment then, let us leave duty in its own domain.</p>
<p>A simple act of love then could be giving your husband a massage, giving
your wife flowers on a random Tuesday, or shoveling the elderly neighbor&rsquo;s
driveway.</p>
<p>In each one of these cases, we can quickly imagine a specific response or
set of reasonable responses one of which the actor might expect in return.
The wife might expect flowers that week or the husband to do that household
task that he has been delaying or to just give her a massage in return. The
husband might expect a foot rub that night or a beer brought to him during
the game or a random sexual favor that week. The neighbor might just expect
a friendly &ldquo;thank you so much&rdquo; or some extra enthusiastic waves that month
or a little note.</p>
<p>It is worth noting here that the actions are not done solely for the
purpose of the expected response, yet nevertheless the response is
expected. For whatever reason, I do not think that we can prevent ourselves
from having these expectations, no matter how <em>pure</em> our intentions.
In my experience, attempting to prevent these expectations only causes
us to emotionally distance ourselves from those around us. <em>Hoping for and
expecting loving responses to our actions of love is, again, entirely
healthy.</em></p>
<p>The trouble comes when none of those responses are forthcoming. It is then
when the sickness of hope deferred begins to well up in our hearts.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a number of these instances need to build up before the
sickness begins to emerge. Other times the sickness begins right away. Generally
if the sickness starts quite soon, it is indicative of a recurrent
pattern of those expectations not being met. Our overall patience bank
is running low.</p>
<p>After the sickness begins to sink in, we may begin to get consumed by the
issue. We can&rsquo;t stop thinking about the response that we expect and
how it is not coming. We may find ourselves trying to draw the response
out of the other person and likely fighting our urges to do so, all
the while possibly scolding ourself for having those urges.</p>
<p>Then an internal moral battle about love might begin inside of us. We might
start scolding ourselves for having expectations about love (due to our
beliefs about love being sacrificial) or scolding ourselves about our
lack of patience.</p>
<p>As the hope continues to be deferred, we may start making plans to change
in some manner to <em>fix the problem</em>. We might decide to tamper down
our expectations or decrease the frequency of our acts of love, knowing
full well that these are but intellectual salves that do nothing to remedy
the root of the problem.</p>
<p>Here, in the throws of this internal turmoil, is where we are in desperate
need of wisdom.</p>
<h3 id="natural-options">Natural Options</h3>
<p>In my own experience of this situation, a number of options emerge.</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to find a way to expend the energy building inside me.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Man up&rsquo; and push the desire somewhere down inside.</li>
<li>Self-soothe and find some way to numb the pain.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these options tend to result in long-term, negative consequences.
Though the build up of negative energy is somewhat temporarily relieved,
it tends to end up finding some deep crevice of my soul in which to hide,
building up a blockage which hinders my overall zest for life and ability
to love. Hope, it seems, is a strong source of our psychic energy, and
storing these wounds of hope deferred within ourselves, either
intentionally or not, zaps our ability to maintain hope in the long term.
Normal tasks, especially regarding the love of others, become increasingly
more difficult the more wounds we store.</p>
<p>The option which I generally tend to take is to self-soothe, usually in
a way which somewhat approximates the feeling that I would have received
from the expected, loving response. For this reason, I have a very
difficult time avoiding substance abuse when I feel hurt. It seems to me
that our natural response to this situation is often indicative of our
greatest weaknesses. It is within this space that many of our insecurities
and character flaws&ndash;our demons&ndash;are born.</p>
<p>I have also found that, in general, the most successful option for me has
been exerting the energy through some sort of productive, physical exertion
such as taking a jog or cleaning out a barn. Activities such as these tend
to allow my focus to shift away and to allow some of the energy to be expelled in
a healthy way. However, the energy is never completely expelled, and more
often than not, will well up inside of me a few hours later, albeit
somewhat less ferociously.</p>
<p>In observing social situations, we can see some of these responses to hope
deferred rather obviously and painfully. In simple situations such as the
telling of a failed joke, the teller will often compensate for their failure
in an indicative way. Perhaps they will quickly make another, more
extravagant joke, or perhaps they will find a way to escape the situation
altogether. While we easily write off these little skirmishes as failures
of social prowess, I believe that we can find in these moments glimpses of
how we deal with unrequited love. Do we lash out in anger, throwing small
insults to regain our standing, or do we push the feelings down inside while
smiling to the world? Few of us, it would seem, tend to press further into
our love. Few of us find in that brief moment an opportunity to open
ourselves more fully to reckless, loving abandon. How would that even look?</p>
<h3 id="christian-options">Christian Options</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or
resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.
Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all
things. Love never ends.
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13&amp;version=ESV">1 Corinthians 13:4-8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Christ spoke about these matters, He generally spoke only about the
physical response. For example, if someone takes your tunic forcefully, give
them your cloak also. How one is to emotionally cope with the situation
He did not say.</p>
<p>Jesus did say, however, that His burden was light. Given the rest of the
New Testament story, it would seem that these instructions from Jesus
about loving others find their causal power in the Holy Spirit. Without
the Spirit, without the love of Christ transforming our own selves, we
do not possess the power to love in such a manner without violating our
own nature and therefore damaging our psyche.</p>
<p>The method for such prescribed actions of love then must involve the
Holy Spirit. How can we tap into the transformative love of the Holy
Spirit in these situations? When hope is deferred, where is the peace
which is promised in that Spirit? How may it be obtained?</p>
<p>Historically Christianity has answered this question with asceticism.
We are taught that to become more Christlike, we must deny our selves
and let Jesus take over our desires. This answer has immediate appeal,
because if our desires are like Christs, then our response will likely
be in kind. However, as we discussed above, Christ Himself hoped for
love in return, so why would His hope deferred not produce the same
outcome as it does for us?</p>
<p>I think that the answer to this question lies in our storehouses of
love and faith. Without the work of Christ, we are left with a fairly
limited reserve of love. We muster up the love ourselves, gathering
strength from our good memories and associated outcomes and emotions.
For Christ, however, love emerged through Him from the storehouse of
God, an ever-flowing river of patient love. The love that Christ gave
was not His own, not garnered from a limited reserve, but flowing out
of an abundant, overflowing relationship.</p>
<p>In this relationship to the Father, Jesus rested in the peace of the
Father&rsquo;s love. He offered up that love, poured out that love, and
when it was not returned there was still ever more to give. Out of
that eternal flow He found an infinite reserve of patience and faith.
When the hope was deferred, the hope was never lost, and He could
press more deeply into that peaceful river and let it flow through
Himself anew.</p>
<p>Here in this vision of Christ I think that we may come closer to an
understanding of His highly prized alone time in the wilderness. For
Christ, His connection with the Father was an absolute necessity. He
needed to carry it with Him throughout every moment in order to love
as He wished to love&ndash;in order to carry the Father&rsquo;s love, He had to
first live within it. And to live within it meant to find that love,
to feel that love daily and in whole.</p>
<p>It would then seem that we are looking at the whole picture from the
wrong angle. Perhaps we will never be able to cope with the pains
of hope deferred in the throws of the moment. Perhaps our strategy
must begin sooner&ndash;before the hope is deferred. Perhaps preparation
is the vital piece which we are missing.</p>
<p>The question then becomes, &lsquo;how do we tap into that storehouse of
love?&rsquo;</p>
<h2 id="answers">Answers</h2>
<p>I honestly am not sure how we tap into that storehouse. That is the
question that I have been asking lately, and I have written much
more on the topic which hopefully will turn into something publishable
in the near future.</p>
<p>Although this article is written in a very <em>objective</em> kind of style,
in all honesty, it was written as an interrogation into one of the
core issues in my own life, an introspection if you will. And although
I have not yet found all the answers to these questions, this beginning,
this hashing out of the issue, led me to start finding some of that
hope in Christ, to start believing in the power of transformative love.</p>
<p>In short, it led me to pray just a tiny bit more&ndash;to let a little bit
of my despair rest in the Father, with the attempted belief that He
actually could and would do something about it.</p>
<p>It led me to let go. To rest in forgiveness when stress overwhelmed me.</p>
<p>And though I can&rsquo;t say that I have accomplished this too much, or even
really understand how to accomplish it, the tree is already bearing
fruit. I leave off with a raw excerpt from my journal tonight&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started to fall asleep, music was playing,
and in that magical, eerie place between waking and sleeping,
the music wafted to me and I felt a peace I have not felt since
youth. As I thought about that feeling, I saw my inner life in
waves of slow, merging pain. I saw the waves of pain, of me
holding down my great disappointment with life. I saw the
possibility of relief.</p>
<p>If it can be like this&hellip;</p>
