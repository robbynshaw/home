  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I am incapable of returning items to a store. This problem is not entirely
based on forgetfulness, though that does play a part, but is due to a
phobia that I developed somewhere along the way. The idea of walking up
to a counter and stating that I would like to return something sends
shivers up my spine. If I attempt said act, I will surely be paralyzed
by utter panic before I make it to the counter. If it were not for my
wife, my counters would fill with unwanted, unopened boxes.</p>
<p>The cause of this phobia has plagued and evaded me for a very long time.
I do not consider myself overly docile, submissive, nor completely
socially inept. In most social settings, I behave myself quite
well. I believe though that I have now found the root of this ailment,
and it is this: <em>Polite children don&rsquo;t exist.</em></p>
<p>Before now, I had at least discovered the mechanism of my phobia, but
not the cause. When analyzing similar situations that caused me to
puddle into panic, I noticed a strong correlation. Each instance was due
to a situation in which I could not reasonably predict the outcome of
the social situation and therefore might upset the other party
unwittingly. For example, this same panic is induced when I am forced
by my wife to order something off the menu. Unable to ascertain whether
the request will be met with disgust or admiration, I quickly and
quietly lose my mind and my wife her everlasting patience. What I only
recently realized was the history of this fear.</p>
<p>I was a sensitive but lively child. My mother is fond of reminding me
of how sensitive I was, perhaps because I have tried hard in my adulthood
to overcome this perceived shortcoming. I was also perceptive and very
eager to please and so spent a considerable amount of my childhood
energy learning how best to please the world of adults.</p>
<p>The best way to please adults, I quickly discovered, was to be polite.
Not that I was particularly good at it, but I did aim to be. From
observation, I also noticed that being polite is nearly equivalent to
not being noticed. This connection was especially applicable in school; my peers
that were noticed were also often the peers getting into trouble. A
successful student learns to be noticed only at the right time&ndash;a well-answered
question, a good mark, the first child to quiet down, etc,.</p>
<p>Some parents teach their children that &ldquo;children are meant to be seen,
not heard.&rdquo; My parents were kind-hearted and empathetic and so did not
teach me this lesson, but I appear to have learned it nevertheless. In
truth, I learned that people, in general, are not meant to be seen or heard
unless that seeing or hearing is a positive moment in some other person&rsquo;s
life. What I learned, because it is exactly what our society teaches, was
that polite children, polite adults even, do not exist. To be perfectly
polite, one should be invisible.</p>
<p>As with many parts of life, I probably took this idea a little too far
and thereby grew a well-formed phobia out of a rather small idea.
Regardless, I believe this societal value is worth pondering for a while.</p>
<p>I recently read a book on psychology that claimed that the first stage
of personal development establishes both the &ldquo;right to exist&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;right to have.&rdquo; These rights, so it said, serve to ground us in our
bodies and upon the earth. This right was news to me. I had never once
considered that I had a right to exist. I was polite&ndash;how could I?</p>
<p>Rights are interesting phenomena in and of themselves. In one sense,
they don&rsquo;t really exist at all. Rights are social constructs, one might
even say myths, that we invent to organize our social behavior. The
inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
are great examples of this. Saying that someone or some group of people
has the right to liberty means nothing unless others agree to that right.
Even our right to life is taken away by some governments in perfectly
legal ways because the society agrees that this is just.</p>
<p>With these thoughts in the back of my mind, hearing that I had a &ldquo;right
to exist&rdquo; was almost laughable to me at first. What could such an idea
possibly mean? Is this <em>right</em> not simply some wild illusion promoted
by feel-good psychologists to buffer an ever-failing cultural
self-esteem? Yet, with all this cynicism bathing my mind, I still could
not help but feel my spine straightening a little at the thought. What
if I really did have a right to exist?</p>
<p>Rights are, as I said, interesting phenomena. One finds it hard to say
the second paragraph of the Declaration of Independence without feeling
a certain <em>gusto</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain, inalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of
Happiness&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If these rights are simply social constructs, some of these phrases are
out of place: self-evident, endowed by their Creator. And we feel them
somewhere deeper than that as well. Perhaps the phenomenon of a
particular right is only outwardly a social construct. Perhaps a right
could exist on its own and be experienced in some direct capacity.</p>
<p>I can feel the &lsquo;right to exist&rsquo; when I imagine myself walking up to a
return counter&ndash;if I hold that mantra steady inside myself. I can see
myself grounding with the very phrase, &ldquo;I have a right to exist&rdquo;&ndash;it&rsquo;s
deeper than just a superficial phrase. The phrase has a truth that speaks
to my Being-in-the-world. The phrase <em>means</em> something very real to
me&ndash;something that I never before fully grasped.</p>
<p>If I say, &ldquo;I have a right to exist,&rdquo; I am saying something about the
nature of my existence in general, but to understand that, we need to
think about the experience of existence in general. My existence is and
was given to me. I found it, but as far as I know, I did not create it;
my existence happened to me and continuously happens to me, whether I
directly will it or not. As such, I do not by default <em>trust</em> my
existence. In fact, my existence may feel no more valid to me than
another person&rsquo;s existence. To some, their existence may feel less valid
than that of those around them. We are not borne into the world knowing
that we matter or even that we are real&ndash;these are determinations that
are hard-won and often constantly at stake.</p>
<p>To say that I have a &ldquo;right to exist&rdquo; is to claim that <em>given existence</em>
as real and valid. That <em>given existence</em> does not stand alone either&ndash;we
add to it, manipulate it, grow it moment by moment. My existence is my
story; I live in and through this story; it is I, and I am it. To claim
that my existence is real and valid is to claim that my story is as real
and valid as your story. It is happening to me; I am happening through
it; this story is real&ndash;I cannot but live through its lens, and its
presence upon this earth is valid in and of itself. The &ldquo;right to exist&rdquo;
is the recognition of an assertion made by the fabric of existence&ndash;that
my story is valid and real.</p>
<p>I am not asking you to simply agree or disagree with the above
statements. We can easily debate statements about words, phrases, and
their place in systems of thought. For instance, we could easily debate
whether the right to liberty is a social construct on which we agree.
But to grasp the nature of a phenomenon is something else entirely. To
talk about it, we must bear witness to it; we must carefully watch
its arising; we must listen to the moments of its life within our soul.
A certain turn of phrase can point to an aspect of Truth that lies in
waiting underneath. I ask you to feel it; to listen to it; to search it
out and witness it. You have a right to exist. Your story is valid and
real.</p>
<hr>
<p>If saying that polite children don&rsquo;t exist is a bit of a stretch, a
variation of the phrase is most certainly true: impolite children
shouldn&rsquo;t exist. Although we may have wonderful parents, as I do, who
instill in us the idea that we are loved unconditionally, the values of
our society and even our religions often claim the exact opposite&ndash;our
existence is contingent on our behavior and our appearance.</p>
<p>This contingency has valid reasons behind it. Ignoring a person is one
of the most effective ways of modifying their behavior. Socially
adept individuals use this technique often without thought and to
powerful effect: turning casually away from someone not following the
social cues, interrupting someone when they are out of place, or simply
walking past someone without making eye contact when they are
inappropriately dressed or placed. To function well as a society and
as individuals, we must draw boundaries when behavior is
inappropriate or destructive.</p>
<p>Even in child-rearing, a decent parent knows that ignoring an unwanted
behavior is often the most salient way to curtail it. We crave
attention&ndash;it validates our existence&ndash;and children (and adults) will go
to many unsavory lengths to acquire it.</p>
<p>Systematically, this methodology of ignoring or containing a person to
adjust their behavior makes a lot of sense, but it is a very sharp sword.
How often do we use it without thought or concern? An idea that becomes
a habit is a dangerous thing. How many decisions do we make with that
habit? How many ideals has that habit engendered?</p>
<p>When I began to ponder the origin of my phobia, I began to probe my youth
for some formative trauma. I suspected that my extreme reaction must
have some grounding moment which led to my ungrounding. In fact, I am
sure that there were many such moments; identities and personality
structures are not often borne of a single mother. I did, nevertheless,
discover one particular moment that I think worth sharing.</p>
<p>One of my earliest moments of self-realization that I can remember
centered around Christianity. I grew up in a devout, protestant home,
and I remember being haunted at a fairly young age by the concept of
hell. I was simply terrified of going there and sure that I was on my
way.</p>
<p>My mother consoled me and used the opportunity to secure my salvation.
I have no issue with my mother, and I put no blame on her. In fact, I&rsquo;m
pretty sure that this was not the way she intended for me to find Jesus.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I am rather appalled by the whole situation. First, I must
be perfectly honest and admit that I believe hell to be very nearly
indefensible biblically; its centrality in the protestant church
perplexes me greatly, but that is a story for another time. My primary
concern here is with the experience that the idea of hell creates&ndash;that is
to say, the <em>experiential truth</em> of hell.</p>
<p>The church in which I grew up espoused the idea that Christ and God loved
me unconditionally. However, the same church also promoted the idea that
without &ldquo;giving your heart to Jesus,&rdquo; I would be damned eternally.
Throughout history, there have been many interpretations of what this
damnation might mean. Generally, the consensus that I learned was that
hell is primarily separation from God&ndash;some even go so far as to say
separation from the love of God. We should note here that in a system in
which God is the originator of life, is in some sense <em>existence</em> itself,
being separated totally from God is utterly unfathomable&ndash;we simply have
no basis from which we could form an experience. Being separated from
God, therefore, is tantamount to no longer existing in any meaningful
way. Of course, something else is often used to approximate the
experience, such as eternal torture, but both concepts evoke a similar
horror and experiential outcome.</p>
<p>The outcome of this concept is simply that the young, impressionable
Christian comes to believe that God&rsquo;s love is not, in fact, unconditional;
it has at very least one condition and often many others which are less
clear, depending on the congregation. And if God&rsquo;s love is conditional,
then it is not much of a leap to say my existence itself is
conditional. Even if the theology might say otherwise, this is the
experience that the concept of hell creates, and as such, is the
experience that many of us teach our children as a basis for their
reality.</p>
<p>Whether or not this belief is <em>true</em> is another topic entirely; I point
it out to show that this concept is traumatizing and show that
it is easy to believe. If our systems and relationships must have
boundaries, why not God&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>This systematic thinking spreads casually across our thoughts and lives.
It is somewhat easy to discipline our children; it is somewhat harder
to empathize with them when their behavior has gone awry.</p>
<p>Many of us Americans will tout the inalienable rights of the
Declaration while simultaneously espousing the necessity of the death
penalty. The right to life is deemed conditional because the proper
functioning of the system demands it. We can debate with facts and
figures whether this is or is not a valid necessity for the system, but
should we not also note that this is precisely where Jesus of Nazareth
drew a literal in the sand? And was it concerning the functioning of the
system that He spoke, or simply the value of a woman&rsquo;s story?</p>
<p>We are quick to draw our own lines in the sand; it is easy to think and
to talk about systems. We do not, however, experience systems in the
deeper parts of our soul&ndash;only their effects. How many times a day do our
systems tell someone that their right to exist is conditional? How many
times today did our own actions do the same?</p>
<p>Even if the system justifies the means, it is at least also a paramount
failure of the imagination to believe that our neighbor&rsquo;s story is not
real and valid. But how could we not feel so if we are unsure for
ourselves if our own story has value?</p>
