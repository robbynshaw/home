  <div class="entry-content"><p>When they banned smoking from bars here in . . . well, everywhere,
the coroner marked the time and date for the spiritual meaning of
the beloved saloon. The bar no longer makes sense, and I sit here
and fondle the thought that this simple, pointed break is crackling
now through the structure, the soft release of a delicate tension,
and this thread skeleton sags under the breath of the still air,
that artful balance of human nature which is the bar is now
crumbling into a dull, dried splatter of blood.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking with these crisp, blue, little eyes&ndash;well, speaking
anyway, or she is&ndash;I&rsquo;m not sure because those crisp, blue, little
eyes keep dancing around mine, and they&rsquo;re so clear and sharp and wet
and round that I want to snatch them out of their strange, little
dance and pop them and delight as they stain my hands blue. They&rsquo;re
too close. They&rsquo;re so close, but they don&rsquo;t see me&ndash;no&ndash;they are
flooded in liquor underneath the veins but naked and ashamed in the
transparent air&ndash;where is the veil of the underworld?</p>
<p>At times an art may become an establishment. If the poetic voice of
the art rings clear and deep and true, if that voice stands tall
from generation to the next, if the art can carry the power to lift
and crush, sustain and destroy without hesitation, and if the art
never shirks or makes defense or explanation but stands ever veiled
in the mystery of poetic utterance, such an art may find itself
erected into an establishment of culture&ndash;a pool of life for a
people who thirst.</p>
<p>A little while earlier, my friend and I were sitting in a booth,
alone, slurping a truth serum that was working, so I listened. I,
the Pied Piper, lulling out his little demons, but there they
stood&ndash;naked in front of me and staring&ndash;lost, confused, with no
trail of smoke to catch hold of and ride through the rafters and
into the dark corners&ndash;no&ndash;there they stood and tied my tongue with
their immodesty.</p>
<p>Listen. Do you hear the shame sickly shuddering through this art,
heralding its demise? Yes, if power is health, health is power, then
shame announces a looming grave. The voice of the art, she trembles,
where once sounded in melodious drone the tragic paradox of
brotherhood&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ndash;We die tonight, we die tonight, we die
and die and die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But on these nights, forever more, we
will only die a little, only in one way, and only alone. So the
night goes on and the knights of the bar go on stupidly toward their
imminent degradation, and I watch as our valiant armor decays to
reveal our base design. But is there a helping hand for a comrade?
No. Tonight we cannot share this death. You find yours and I find
mine and look to the stars when you die.</p>
<p>So says the coroner on his ghastly trol&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ndash;Shame breedeth mediocrity, but when death takes her
final bow, we will brush the lips with crimson and forget the many
mornings of this dull, fading pink.</p>
<p>We die tonight.
We die tonight.
We die. And die. And die.</p>
</blockquote>
