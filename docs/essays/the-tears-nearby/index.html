  <div class="entry-content"><p>These days, these precious days which I can hardly touch, my tears are always only ever a loosened breath away. I hate them, I miss them, I beckon them, and I retreat.</p>
<p>The days before I drove to the hospital, my mind was on the character of greatness. Across the hospital bed in the PICU, I watched my mother and her sad eyes reassure, caress, hold steady. Greatness is a calm and swelling ocean in a tender shell.</p>
<p>In this age, the siren calls to a pseudo-grandeur. Empires of many vibrant colors and fascinating shapes emerge out of vaporous airs, challenging our own importance. We teach our children to reach out for the stars. There are so many, varied stars.</p>
<p>Each time that I set sail towards the siren&rsquo;s dangerous rocks, a new version of me sets out to sea. So much energy and hope and manic desire strained away, lurching up and out and over the waves of fate and time.</p>
<p>After some years, I broke down. And as I sat huddled alone in my car, billowing smoke through the frigid slit above the window, I began to see my ships circling around me through the smoky ocean spray. So many ships with so many versions of myself. Some lost entirely, some abandoned, and so many charting manic courses with short supplies. None of them all of me, but the total of them with most.</p>
<p>The weekend after we got back from the hospital, we put up the Christmas tree with the kids. The magic spilled from the children over the branches, through the lights and into their laughter. We put them to bed, and I reclined by the tree&ndash;one of my favorite past-times in this life. But this time I stared blankly at the tree&ndash;the magic was gone. It&rsquo;s been fading every year, encroaching like the &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Never Ending Story.&rdquo; And now we sit, the &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; and I.</p>
<p>The captain of one of my ships is into Eastern philosophy, though he is one of the least well supplied on his voyage. He tells me of this balance between <em>being</em> and <em>doing</em>. He laughs at the irony of himself on a ship, sailing out to learn to <em>be</em>. He hails the neighboring yoga masters and self-help gurus on their jet-fast Insta-boats as they pass by.</p>
<p>The first time that this sadness rose up so vehemently within me, the first time that I broke, the process was interrupted. A terrible tragedy roused me out of my own <em>great depression</em>, and I stumbled back into the light. When the chaos died down, I set out to tame the ships by being well organized. I can remember the dreadful imperative that I felt for my mission&ndash;the ships were sinking fast.</p>
<p>Of course, sending supplies to sinking ships is a fools endeavor.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can only hold the hand of a child as they quietly struggle to survive. This might be the one truth.</p>
<p>Controlling behaviors and outcomes is game of calculated absurdity which we often call <em>maturing</em>. Often forces emerge into our lives which defy the most deft handling, stallions which resist the tame. Often we bid these forces live with us, and we begin to change, for better or worse.</p>
<p>When we turn living and loving into trying, we necessarily distance ourselves from the rawness of love&ndash;from empathy. At least that&rsquo;s what happened to me. Sometime we just want to heal&ndash;to stop the pain for the ones we love. But there is a healing which looks for order and reason, and there is a healing which waters and watches as tender vines curl around lattice. The former leads to a distance self-imposed. The former leads to ships sailing in a ragged, ice-torn sea.</p>
<p>If we are not careful, as I was not, empathy abandoned retreats deep into the recesses of the heart, placid yet boiling with a stern reticence. Her throne lost, she weeps quietly in our dreams. And if we dare to let her free again, she will careen vengefully across the landscape of our inner lives.</p>
<p>Love is patient. If love were not patient, it could not see across the chasm. Tender vines take a long time to grow, but one must first see the vine. Look but only caress. Listen but only breathe.</p>
<p>As I drove away from the PICU for the final time, she sat calmly on the hood of the car, her hair billowing in the crisp winter wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you abandon me again?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>I did not answer. I did not want to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fading you know. The ships are sinking,&rdquo; she said in a soft, matter-of-fact way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be waiting for me there,&rdquo; I replied stupidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t there. You just needed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you stay?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She stared forward. I held back the tears pushing at my eyelids, and she began to fade away.</p>
