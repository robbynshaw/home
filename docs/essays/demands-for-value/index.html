  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometime last year, as darkness was creeping, I was asking &lsquo;what for.&rsquo; Unresolved, I drove to work. Night shift.</p>
<p>I turned to the East, my normal path, marking a course through veiled country fields, and turned to the driver&rsquo;s side window. Painted across the black were the Northern Lights in full glory. I felt an Aurora virgin.</p>
<p>The lights struck me as an immediate though ambiguous answer: <em>beauty</em>. But more, a demand. The moment demanded to be valued.</p>
<p>In my slightly educated opinion, the Post-Modern dilemma, i.e. the reason why we are going nowhere quite quickly and on anti-depressants, i.e. the death of grounding Truth, can be summed up quite easily as an unanswered question: if God/the Good/Truth cannot be logically found, on what will we base our lives and truths?</p>
<p>I have this vague inclination that the answer lies in something like these &ldquo;demands for value.&rdquo; We all have them. They occur most when we are open, when we are young, when the world is Being and she still speaks&ndash;before our eyes are darkened by a crisp overlay of patterns and pursuits. Some are painful, others soft. They etch the outline of our adult souls, though we may never remember.</p>
<p>The problem with the Post-Modern realization is that we are stuck within ourselves. Any Truth is always our truth, because, alas, we are always I. Logically we will never escape this frustration. Yet, in experience&hellip;</p>
<p>In experience, something often reaches across.</p>
<p>The giftedness of the moment.</p>
<p>Beauty is empty. As Zen as you may be, the flower is only a glorious flower. Yet Being speaks. The flower was given, and only in that light does it open.</p>
<p>Some moments demand darker values. Witnessing a tragedy, we see the gift violated.</p>
<p>The sanctity of human life is something that none of us can give, not with a thousand years of meditation. Yet there it is, wrestling in our souls, carved out by Aurora and her legion sisters.</p>
<p>Motivation for life? Adam and Eve. Caretakers. Husbandry. Empty if the gift is not.</p>
